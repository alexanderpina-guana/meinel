The current version of the website outputs two headings: one representing the website's name and the other representing the name of the About Me section. 
Under that is a paragraph section that describes the website and its contents. Below that, five images are chosen to direct to articles representing the website's topics. There is also an image in the background. Finally, some footers contain two placeholder contacts. A placeholder email and a placeholder phone number. All sections of text have backgrounds that make them more readable.
